## Requirements

To use the content of this repository, ensure you have the following.

- MATLAB version R2021a or later installed. 
- Third-party functions downloaded from [MATLAB'S File Exchange](https://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/): `worstcase`, `MCErrorPropagation`, `swtest.m`, `FMINSEARCHBND`, `m_map`, `brewermap`, `longhurst_v4_2010`, `subaxis` and `plotBarStackGroups`. Once downloaded, please place the functions in the `./resources/external/` directory.
- MATLAB toolboxes: the [Optimization Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/optimization.html), necessary to run `worstcase`, and the [Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html), necessary to run `MCErrorPropagation` and `swtest.m`.

## Data used in this repository

This project uses various raw oceanographic datasets downloaded from online repositories, stored in the `./data/raw/` folder.

- Particle concentration measurements from the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5) downloaded from the EcoPart repository hosted by [IFREMER](https://ecopart.obs-vlfr.fr). This dataset is stored in the subfolder `./data/raw/UVP5`.
- Particulate organic carbon (POC) flux measurements from sediment traps and radionuclides, a compilation that we made for this study. The file, `dataset_s0_trap_and_radionuclide_compilation.xlsx`, is not available within this repository as it contains data owned by other authors that are not in a preservation repository. References for constructing this dataset are provided in the Supporting Information of our paper, Tables S1-S6.

Due to their large size, the following datasets are not included in `./data/raw/` but instructions for acquiring them are provided. Place the corresponding `.mat` files in `./data/raw/`. 

- The World Ocean Atlas 2018 monthly climatology for **temperature**, which you can download from the [NOAA website](https://accession.nodc.noaa.gov/NCEI-WOA18). Once downloaded, read all the .nc files and store them in a single array and save it as `woa18_global.mat`. This file is necessary to run the Marsay et al. (2015) algorithm.
- The AVHRR Pathfinder v.5.0 global 4 km monthly climatology (1985--2001) for **sea surface temperature**, which you can download from the [NOAA website](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/archive/accession/AVHRR_Pathfinder-NODC-v5.0-climatologies). Once downloaded, read all the .nc files and store them in a single array and save it as `sst_global.mat`. This file is necessary to run the Henson et al. (2012) algorithm.
- The SeaWiFS 9 km monthly climatology (1997--2010) for **chlorophyll concentration** and **photosynthetically available radiation**, which you can downlaod from the [NASA website](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/l3/). Once downloaded, read all the .nc files and store them in a single array and save it as `chla_seawifs_global.mat` and `par0_seawifs_global.mat` respectively. These files are necessary to run the Henson et al. (2012) algorithm.

## Available MATLAB scripts in the folder `./code`

## Reproducibility

Our scripts showcase the application of Monte Carlo-based techniques for error propagation across diverse datasets of biological carbon pump (BCP) mesopelagic transfer efficiency metrics. Specifically, the scripts are hard-wired to handle data from our six designated study sites:
- the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) station ALOHA (HOT/ALOHA), in the subtropical NE Pacific (22.45ºN, 158ºW);
- the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series/Oceanic Flux Program joint site (BATS/OFP), in the subtropical NW Atlantic (31.6ºN, 64.2ºW);
- the US JGOFS Equatorial Pacific process study experimental site (EqPac), in the central equatorial Pacific upwelling system (–2 to 2ºN, 140ºW);
- the Porcupine Abyssal Plain time-Series Observatory (PAP-SO), in the subpolar NE Atlantic (49.0ºN, 16.5ºW);
- Ocean Station Papa (OSP), in the HNLC region of the subpolar NE Pacific (50ºN, 145ºW), and
- the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) observatory HAUSGARTEN, in the polar Atlantic-Arctic boundary (79ºN, 4.0ºE).
